# People, Process & Technology (PPT)

To outline the steps for achieving delivery in an Agile cross-functional team from a People, Process, and Technology perspective. 
Below is a structured approach with workflow charts, service maps, and architecture diagrams.

## People Perspective

 - Workflow Chart: Team Collaboration

```
[Team Structure]   →   [Agile Ceremonies] → [Communication Strategies] → [Cross-Team Collaboration]
   |                         |                       |                            |
Backend Engineers      Sprint Planning             Slack                          Sprint Reviews
Frontend Engineers     Daily Standups              Jira                            Retrospectives
QA Engineers           Sprint Demos               Confluence                      Knowledge Sharing
DevOps Engineers       Backlog Grooming          Teams Meetings                  Escalation Process

```
- Service Map: Team Interactions

```
[Product Owner] → [Backend Team] →   [Frontend Team] →  [QA Team]    →      [DevOps Team]
       |                |                  |                |                |
Requirements       API Development     UI Development    Testing           Deployment
       |                |                   |                |                |
Stakeholders       Database Design     Responsiveness    Bug Reporting     Monitoring
```

- Best Practices

i. Cross-Functional Teams: Ensure each team has a mix of skills to reduce dependencies.

ii. Clear Escalation Process: Define how blockers and risks are escalated and resolved (Team, Engineering Manager, Produc Owner, then CTO).

iii. Continuous Feedback: Encourage open communication and regular feedback loops.


## Process Perspective

- Workflow Chart: End-to-End Development Process 

```

[Product Idea] → [Requirements Gathering] → [Sprint Planning] → [Development] → [Code Review] → [Testing]      →    [Release]   →      [Monitor & Improve]
       |                |                        |                   |                |                |                  |
Stakeholders       Backlog Grooming          Task Allocation     Assignment    Peer Reviews     Automated Tests       CI/CD Pipeline        User Feedback

```

- Service Map: CI/CD Pipeline
  
```
[Code Commit] → [Build] → [Unit Tests] → [Integration Tests] → [Deploy to Staging] → [End-to-End Tests] → [Deploy to Production] → [Monitor]
       |                |                   |                        |                        |                        |                        |
GitHub Actions      Docker Images        Jest/Cypress             Kubernetes              Selenium           GitHub Actions/Jenkins  Prometheus/Grafana
```

_Explanation of Alignment:_

i. Code Commit:


Tool: GitHub Actions (for version control and triggering the pipeline).


ii. Build:


Tool: Docker Images (for containerizing the application).

iii. Unit Tests:

Tool: Jest/Cypress (for running unit tests).


iv. Integration Tests:

Tool: Kubernetes (for orchestrating the deployment of services for integration testing).


v. Deploy to Staging:


Tool: Selenium (for automated end-to-end testing in the staging environment).


v. End-to-End Tests:

Tool: GitHub Actions/Jenkins (for orchestrating the end-to-end test suite).


vi. Deploy to Production:

Tool: GitHub Actions/Jenkins (for deploying the application to production).


vii. Monitor:

Tool: Prometheus/Grafana (for monitoring application performance and generating alerts).
