# People, Process & Technology (PPT)

To outline the steps for achieving delivery in an Agile cross-functional team from a People, Process, and Technology perspective. 
Below is a structured approach with workflow charts, service maps, and architecture diagrams.

## People Perspective

 - Workflow Chart: Team Collaboration

```
[Team Structure]   →   [Agile Ceremonies] → [Communication Strategies] → [Cross-Team Collaboration]
   |                         |                       |                            |
Backend Engineers      Sprint Planning             Slack                          Sprint Reviews
Frontend Engineers     Daily Standups              Jira                            Retrospectives
QA Engineers           Sprint Demos               Confluence                      Knowledge Sharing
DevOps Engineers       Backlog Grooming          Teams Meetings                  Escalation Process

```
- Service Map: Team Interactions

```
[Product Owner] → [Backend Team] →   [Frontend Team] →  [QA Team]    →      [DevOps Team]
       |                |                  |                |                |
Requirements       API Development     UI Development    Testing           Deployment
       |                |                   |                |                |
Stakeholders       Database Design     Responsiveness    Bug Reporting     Monitoring
```

- Best Practices:

i. Cross-Functional Teams: Ensure each team has a mix of skills to reduce dependencies.

ii. Clear Escalation Process: Define how blockers and risks are escalated and resolved (Team, Engineering Manager, Produc Owner, then CTO).

iii. Continuous Feedback: Encourage open communication and regular feedback loops.


## Process Perspective

Workflow Chart: End-to-End Development Process

[Product Idea] → [Requirements Gathering] → [Sprint Planning] → [Development] → [Code Review] → [Testing]      →          [Release] →    [Monitor & Improve]
       |                |                        |                   |                |                |                  |
Stakeholders       Backlog Grooming          Task                 Assignment    Peer Reviews     Automated Tests       CI/CD Pipeline        User Feedback
