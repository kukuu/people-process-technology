# Culture adaptation

These case studies re-inforces adaptation to diverse technical delivery environments and driving results.

**_1. Finding Simplicity:_**
   
Situation: In my role at VW Finance as an Engineering Dev Manager, I inherited a legacy monolithic system used for processing real-time transactions. The process for onboarding new clients was complex, involving multiple manual steps and requiring weeks of effort.

Task: My goal was to simplify the process to improve customer satisfaction and reduce onboarding time from weeks to days without compromising data integrity or compliance.

Action: I proposed breaking the monolith into microservices, starting with the onboarding module. I worked closely with stakeholders to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and implement an API-based onboarding portal for clients. By leveraging CI/CD pipelines and Docker for testing and deployment, I ensured the solution was scalable and secure.

Result: The onboarding process was reduced to 48 hours, client satisfaction scores improved by 30%, and the team saved over 100 hours per month in manual effort. This approach also paved the way for scaling other modules as microservices, driving efficiency across the system.

**_2. Collaboration & Partnership:_**

Situation: While leading a full-stack team during a data migration project at Marks and Spencer, I had to collaborate with a distributed team across three continents: EMEA. Midway through the project, unexpected performance bottlenecks in data ingestion disrupted timelines.

Task: I needed to realign the team, resolve the bottlenecks, and ensure delivery of the migration within the scheduled timeline while maintaining high data quality.

Action: I facilitated a cross-functional workshop with the data engineering and DevOps teams to analyze the problem. After identifying inefficiencies in batch processing, I proposed using a streaming architecture with Apache Kafka. Additionally, I created a shared Slack channel for real-time communication and introduced daily standups with the distributed team to improve visibility and collaboration.

Result: The team resolved bottlenecks in two weeks, and the migration was completed on time. The streaming architecture reduced ingestion latency by 40%, and the improved communication process became a model for future cross-functional projects.



**_3. Learning Agility:_**
   
Situation: In a fast-paced health-tech startup working as Tech Lead, I was assigned to lead the integration of a third-party machine learning (ML) API for patient diagnostics—a technology I had limited prior experience. The deadline for integration was tight due to regulatory pressures.

Task: I needed to quickly understand the ML API, assess its technical requirements, and implement the integration without compromising security or compliance.

Action: I dedicated the first week to intensive learning, reviewing the API documentation, attending webinars, and collaborating with the vendor’s technical team. I also organized a knowledge-sharing session for my team to align on the API’s capabilities and limitations. By leveraging my full-stack expertise, I designed a secure middleware service for the integration, ensuring seamless communication between the API and our application.

Result: The integration was completed ahead of schedule, and the system successfully passed all regulatory audits. My learning agility not only enabled the project’s success but also empowered the team to confidently tackle similar challenges in the future. Since then I architected and led the SMART Meter Digital Twin for OFGEM an initiative for the MHHR project - https://digital-twin-v2-chi.vercel.app/
 
**_4. Motivations_**

Situation: I have always been passionate about creating innovative, scalable, and user-centered solutions that have a real-world impact. This drive aligns closely with Skyscanner’s mission to make travel planning seamless for millions of users worldwide. My work on the FIFA World Cup 2022 reinforced my passion for tackling complex challenges to deliver impactful outcomes.

Task: During the FIFA World Cup 2022, I was responsible for designing and integrating a scalable voting system that allowed millions of fans to vote in real-time for "Player of the Match." The system needed to handle unpredictable spikes in traffic, maintain accurate voting results, and ensure security and fairness.

Action: I collaborated with cross-functional teams, including backend engineers, DevOps, and UX designers, to design a microservices-based architecture for the voting system. By leveraging technologies such as AWS Lambda for serverless processing, DynamoDB for high-performance data storage, and a robust CDN for efficient content delivery, I ensured the system was highly scalable and resilient. I also implemented rate limiting, authentication mechanisms, and monitoring tools (e.g., CloudWatch) to handle security and observability requirements.

Result: The voting system processed over 5 million votes seamlessly during peak matches, maintained 99.9% uptime, and delivered results in real-time. The system became a celebrated feature of the event, increasing fan engagement and ensuring a fair and transparent voting process. This experience deepened my passion for working on high-impact systems, motivating me to join organizations like Skyscanner that aim to enhance experiences for a global audience.
